When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	-When I want to share my work with others or when I want to keep what I did in more than one place for safe keeping.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	-Because some of your changes can break something in the program.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	-Forks are clone that you use inside GitHub to clone other people repositories, and clones do the same thing to your computer and branch creates another version of your program.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	-You can check what changes you made offline.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	-I'd collaborate via e-mail, Git would be way easier, and thats what I will do for now on.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	-When I want someone to check my work before I merge into master. You can change direct into master when you are doing a small project by your self,
	and you should create another branch when you are collaborating with others using pull requests.
