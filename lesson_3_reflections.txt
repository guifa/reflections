When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	-When I want to share my work with others or when I want to keep what I did in more than one place for safe keeping.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	-Because some of your changes can break something in the program.
