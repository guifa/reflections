How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    -When you can see both files side by side its easier to see what changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    -I can see how my code proressed and if the changes that I make are better.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    -Pro: You have flexibility, and you can use your judgement to choose when to commit.
    -Con: Not always what you think is correct, would be the correct commit for other people.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because there is a relation betwen files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show all the changes made to my file and diff let me see the difference between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can do anything while using git and if something breaks i can just go back to a previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For every code that i make for now on.
